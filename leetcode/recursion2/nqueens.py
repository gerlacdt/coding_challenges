"""The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n
chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Example:

Input: 4 Output: 2

Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle
as shown below.

[
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
